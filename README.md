Author: Mohamed Ifqir

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for implementing robot navigation using the TD3 algorithm with ROS Noetic. TD3 is a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to control the motion of a robot in a simulated environment.

The project leverages ROS Noetic, which is a popular framework for building robotic systems, and utilizes the PyTorch library for implementing the TD3 algorithm.

## Prerequisites

- ROS Noetic: Install ROS Noetic on your system. Visit the [ROS Installation Guide](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation) for instructions.

- Python 3: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

- PyTorch: Install PyTorch by following the instructions on the [official website](https://pytorch.org/).
